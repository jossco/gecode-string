Instructions for installing the Kaluza binary intended for Ubuntu 9.x,
on Ubuntu 14.x

I've only tested this on a 32-bit install.

requires:
  ant
  ocaml
  g++
  openjdk-6-jdk

1) In KaluzaBin/hampi/configure, change this line:

    export JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/include/

2) Build zchaff:
    (Do not 'make all'!! Some of the extra utilities won't compile any longer.)
    (The included version of zchaff seems to have an added Ocaml wrapper, which CFGanalyzer requires.)
    
    cd KaluzaBin/hampi/lib/cfganalyzer-2007-12-03/zchaff-src
    make
    cd ..
    
3) Build CFGanalyzer:
   (this only works for the included version; in newer versions, linking to zchaff os different)
   
    cd KaluzaBin/hampi/lib/cfganalyzer-2007-12-03
    edit Makefile:	
      - comment out zchaff-src rule
      - ZCHAFF-INST-DIR=zchaff-src
    make depend
    make
    cd ..
    
4) Build Java bridge for STP:

    cd stp-jni
    (export JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre')
    edit Makefile:
      - change hard-coded java include directories in all32/all64
      
5) Build hampi:

    cd KaluzaBin/hampi
    ./configure
    make
    
6) Download yices binary:
   (1.0.27 is recommended; 1.0.40 appears to work, as well)
   
    cd KaluzaBin
    download:	
      http://yices.csl.sri.com/cgi-bin/yices-newlicense.cgi?file=yices-1.0.27-i686-pc-linux-gnu-static-gmp.tar.gz	
    tar -xfz yices-1.0.27-i686-pc-linux-gnu-static-gmp.tar.gz

7) Test it:

    export KALUZABIN=`pwd`
    ./RunKal.sh SATKaluzaRegTests/substr.readable var_0xINPUT_2
