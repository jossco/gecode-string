kaluzish - kaluza to minizinc translation

The kaluzish python script parses a kaluza input file and generates a minizinc model.
For usage:
  kaluzish --help

Requires the pyparsing module:
  easy_install pyparsing

Requires MiniZinc 2.0

To run the generated minizinc file in gecode (assuming you have gecode and minizinc, and your path is set correctly):
  mzn-gecode -Ilibdir -D "wordlen=xx" example.mzn
where 'libdir' is the path to the kaluzish/mznlib directory, and 'xx' is the upper bound on string lengths.
